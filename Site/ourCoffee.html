                    <span class="text">Whether you're looking for ways to reduce your caffeine intake for health reasons, 
                      or simply craving a cup of coffee late in the day, but don't want to be up all 
                      night, decaf might be the answer. Decaffeinated coffee, known as decaf for short, 
                      is ordinary coffee that has had most of its caffeine removed from it before the 
                      beans are roasted. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for a coffee 
                      to be marketed as "decaffeinated," it must have had at least 97 percent of its original caffeine removed.  </span>

                    <span class="text">A small upright evergreen shrub or small tree that is grown in tropical climates.  
                      Grown as a houseplant in temperate climates with well-draining potting soil.  
                      Needs bright light and high humidity indoors but if taken outdoors prefers 
                      some partial shade.  Plant in organically rich-well drained soil. 
                      After 3-4 years small white fragrant blooms will appear from late spring 
                      to early summer. Fissured bark appears on older branches. 
                      Berries are edible with a pulpy grape-like texture, but it is the seeds (coffee beans) 
                      that are sought after. Berries are picked by hand when ripe and de-pulped, 
                      with the extracted seeds/beans then dried in the sun before roasting and grinding 
                      to produce the popular beverage coffee.</span>

                      It has a light body and medium acidity, resulting in a very mellow and relaxed cup of coffee.
                     It is a roasted coffee with notes of toasted malt and baking chocolate.</span>

                      It can be described as a bit bitter due to higher caffeine content but is said to add flavor depth.
                      Well washed robusta beans are used in making strong espresso which provides the aromatic crema and is 
                      what Italy is known for.
                      A high quality Robusta bean will have a hint of chocolate and malt notes if roasted right.</span>
